Description of contents: 

 These files contain results of the scene modelling photometry for each of
 the spectroscopically confirmed or spectroscopically probable Type Ia 
 supernovae from the 2005 season of the SDSS supernova survey.
 There is a single file for each of the 146 different supernovae.
 Each file contains a header section that gives information about the
 particular supernova: 

  SDSS CID: internal SDSS designation
  IAU: IAU designation if it exists
  RA/DEC: J2000 coordinates
  Z/ZERR: redshift and its error, as determined by the SDSS SN team (see 
          Zheng et al. 2008)
  SDSS TYPE: internal SDSS type (120=SNIa, 119=probable SNIa, 118=SNIa
          confirmed by another team)
  GALAXY_SB: galaxy SB (asinh mag/square arcsec) at the location of
          the SN, for assumed 1.2" FWHM seeing
  SFD extinction: foreground extinction from Schlegel, Finkbeiner, & Davis 
          in the direction of the SN (but this correction has NOT been
          applied to the data)
 The header also contains a few notes on the definition of the data columns.

 The data sections contain fifteen columns:

 1. FLAG: gives values of the photometry flags (see paper) for each measurement.
   FLAG==0 means there are no liens on the measurement. 
   FLAG>1024 means the measurement is likely bad. For 0<FLAG<1024, the 
   measurement is likely OK, but there was some lien on the frames so it was 
   not used to constrain the galaxy background (except for 16 and 32). 
   See paper for more details.
 2. MJD: modified Julian date of the measurement.
 3. FILT: gives the filter in which the measurement was obtained: [01234] 
   corresponds to [ugriz].
 4. MAG: gives the asinh magnitude of the supernova for this epoch and filter
   in the native SDSS photometric system
 5. ERR: gives the error on the magnitude
 6. SKYERR: gives an estimate of systematic error from uncertainty in
   sky determination
 7. GALERR: gives an estimate of systematic error from uncertainty in
   galaxy background determination
 8. FLUX: gives the derived flux in microJansky, using the SDSS/AB correction
   from the paper: ABmag-SDSSmag = [ -0.037 0.024 0.005 0.018 0.016 ] for 
   [ugriz]
 9. FLUXERR: error in the flux
 10. SKYERR: as column 6, but in flux units
 11. GALERR: as column 7, but in flux units
 12. NPRE: gives the number of available frames before 2005, which 
   constrain the total brightness of the underlying galaxy.
 13. TELE: gives the telescope used for the measurment, always sdss here
 14. RUN: gives the SDSS run number in which the observation was obtained
 15. STRIP: the SDSS strip identification, either 82N or 82S for these data

System requirements: None. These are text files.

Additional comments: None.
